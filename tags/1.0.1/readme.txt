Easily import structured data and schema.org settings from any XML or CSV file to WordLift knowledge graph.

== Description ==

Importing your data from CSV or XML feeds into structured data properties formatted for schema.org can be a time-consuming
process.

By using the WordLift Add-On for [WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import "WordPress XML & CSV Import")
you can easily drag&drop your external data into the matching schema.org properties. In the 'Edit Import' screen just drag
your data on the right side into the fields on the left side.

== Installation ==

First, install [WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import "WordPress XML & CSV Import").

* Unzip all-import-wordlift-add-on.zip and upload the contents to /wp-content/plugins/, and then activate the plugin from the Plugins page in WordPress

The Yoast WordLift Add-On will appear in the Step 3 of WP All Import.
